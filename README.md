# About
This is an attack simulation tool with a teaching purpose. This software sends a uid back to the server that can verify this software was run in the past on that machine. 



# Story
In the good old days, we had serious issues with the security approach. Most of the colleges do not have time to do the minimum safety measures. We had a simple rule we sent a love letter to management when someone left the machine open. This is fun sometimes. But was not enough. That was when this idea came.
We made a game that had to hack each other system without the victim recognizing that was happening. Every successful attempt will be a 5% bonus, every victim evidence is a main no bonus, and each attack recognition was a 5% bonus plus 5% if the attacker is identified. 
So the maximum bonus was 15% if the attacker came to a victim. That was a moral destroyer game however was no successful attack after the first 2 months. 
We build some code that reads some unique ID from the machine plus one UID from the attacker. This project is a similar tool that should serve a similar purpose in the future.
